Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)

Jupyter Notebook

PowerPoint (for presentation: Project Data Visualization and Observations.pptx)

ðŸ“Œ Key Features
Data Cleaning:  Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

Visualization:  Plotted distributions, correlations, price maps, and review frequencies.

Geospatial Analysis: Assessed price and availability patterns across locations.

Host Analysis: Compared host types and their pricing strategies.

Review Analysis: Explored customer feedback volume and frequency.

ðŸ“ˆ Notable Insights
Certain neighborhoods consistently show higher pricing.

Superhosts tend to have better reviews and higher occupancy.
